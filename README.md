#  Rock paper scissor game 🪨📃✂️
 Rock-paper-scissors is a game usually played by two players , where players simultaneously form one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. 
The "rock" beats scissors, the "scissors" beat paper and the "paper" beats rock; if both players throw the same shape, the game is tied.
